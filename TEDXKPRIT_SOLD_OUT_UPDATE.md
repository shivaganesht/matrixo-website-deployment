## 🎨 Visual Design:

### Color Scheme for Sold Out:
- **Badge Background:** Red (`bg-red-600`)
- **Border:** Red (`border-red-500`)
- **Text:** White on red background
- **Notice Boxes:** Light red background with red border
- **Animation:** Pulse effect on main badges

### User Experience:
1. **Clear Communication** - Multiple sold out indicators
2. **No Confusion** - All booking buttons disabled
3. **Professional** - Thanking users for response
4. **Consistent** - Same messaging across all pages

---

## 📍 Where Users Will See "SOLD OUT":

### Events Listing Page (`/events`)
1. ✅ Red badge on event card (top-right)
2. ✅ Sold out notice instead of price
3. ✅ No "Book" button

### Event Detail Page (`/events/tedxkprit-2025-break-the-loop`)
1. ✅ Sold out badge in hero section (top)
2. ✅ Mobile: Sold out notice instead of "Register Now" button
3. ✅ Ticket section: Large sold out notice box
4. ✅ Each ticket: Disabled "SOLD OUT" button

---

## 🔒 Backend Protection:

The following backend protections are **still active**:

### Google Apps Script (`doGet` function):
```javascript
const totalCapacity = eventId.includes('tedxkprit') ? 90 : 2000;
if (ticketsSold >= totalCapacity) {
  throw new Error('Event is sold out');
}
```

### Frontend Check (`EventRegistrationForm.tsx`):
```typescript
if (checkData.ticketsSold >= soldOutLimit) {
  throw new Error('Event is sold out')
}
```

**Protection Layers:**
1. ✅ Visual UI - Users can't click book buttons
2. ✅ Frontend validation - Pre-check before submission
3. ✅ Backend validation - Google Script enforces limit
4. ✅ Data model - Status field marks event as sold out

---
