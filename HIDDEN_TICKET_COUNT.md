# 🔒 Hidden Ticket Count Implementation

## Overview
Ticket counts are now **completely hidden** from all frontend UI, but still tracked in the backend to automatically close registrations at 90 for TEDxKPRIT.

---

## What Changed

### ❌ **REMOVED from Frontend UI:**

1. **Events Listing Page (`/events`):**
   - ❌ "X / Y sold" text
   - ❌ "% sold" percentage
   - ❌ Progress bar showing tickets sold
   - ❌ `getAvailableTickets()` function

2. **Event Detail Page:**
   - ❌ Already removed in previous update
   - ❌ Ticket stats section
   - ❌ Loading spinner for ticket count
   - ❌ "X tickets remaining" text

3. **All Pages:**
   - ❌ No ticket count visible anywhere
   - ❌ Users cannot see capacity or sold count
   - ❌ Cleaner, simpler UI

### ✅ **KEPT in Backend:**

1. **Google Apps Script:**
   - ✅ Counts registrations from Google Sheets
   - ✅ Checks if count >= 90
   - ✅ Blocks new registrations when limit reached
   - ✅ Returns "sold out" error

2. **Frontend Registration Form:**
   - ✅ Pre-checks ticket count before submission
   - ✅ Shows "SOLD OUT" error if limit reached
   - ✅ No UI display, only validation

## User Experience

### Before (Old):
```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ TEDxKPRIT 2025             │
│ -------------------------  │
│ 85 / 90 sold      94% sold │
│ [████████████░░] Progress  │
│                            │
│ 5 tickets remaining        │
│ [Book Now Button]          │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

### After (New):
```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ TEDxKPRIT 2025             │
│                            │
│ From ₹499                  │
│ [Book Now Button]          │
│                            │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

**Cleaner, simpler, no pressure!**

## How It Works Now

### Registration Flow:

```
User clicks "Book Now"
    ↓
Opens registration form
    ↓
Fills details & uploads payment
    ↓
Clicks Submit
    ↓
Frontend: Check count (hidden API call)
    ↓
Is count >= 90?
    ↓
NO → Submit to Google Sheet → Success ✅
YES → Block submission → Show "SOLD OUT" 🚫
```

### Backend Validation:

```javascript
// Google Apps Script (happens invisibly)
const ticketsSold = countRegistrations(eventId)
const limit = eventId.includes('tedxkprit') ? 90 : 2000

if (ticketsSold >= limit) {
  throw new Error('Event is sold out')
  // Registration rejected
}
```

---

## Files Modified

### 1. `components/events/EventsListing.tsx`

**Removed:**
- `getAvailableTickets()` function
- `availableTickets` variable
- `percentSold` calculation
- Entire "Ticket Info" section with progress bar

**Result:**
- Event cards now show only: Title, Date, Location, Price, Button
- Cleaner 3-column grid layout
- File size: 8.57 kB → **8.41 kB** (smaller!)

### 2. `components/events/EventDetail.tsx`

**Already Removed (previous update):**
- All ticket count state variables
- API calls to fetch count
- Ticket stats display section
- Loading states

### 3. `components/events/EventRegistrationForm.tsx`

**Backend Check (kept but hidden):**
```typescript
// This runs silently before submission
const checkResponse = await fetch(
  `${GOOGLE_SCRIPT_URL}?action=getTicketCount&eventId=${eventId}`,
  { cache: 'no-store' }
)

if (checkData.ticketsSold >= 90) {
  throw new Error('SOLD_OUT')
  // Shows: "🎫 SOLD OUT! Event has reached maximum capacity"
}
```

**User Never Sees:**
- The API call happening
- The actual ticket count
- How many spots are left

**User Only Sees:**
- Success message (if accepted)
- "SOLD OUT" error (if limit reached)

---

## Backend Logic (Google Apps Script)

### GET Request (Hidden Check):
```javascript
// Called silently by frontend before submission
function doGet(e) {
  const eventId = e.parameter.eventId
  const ticketsSold = countFromSheet(eventId)
  const totalCapacity = eventId.includes('tedxkprit') ? 90 : 2000
  
  return JSON.stringify({
    success: true,
    ticketsSold: ticketsSold,      // Hidden from users
    totalCapacity: totalCapacity,  // Hidden from users
  })
}
```

### POST Request (Registration):
```javascript
// Double-checks before saving
function doPost(e) {
  const data = JSON.parse(e.postData.contents)
  const ticketsSold = countFromSheet(data.eventId)
  const limit = data.eventId.includes('tedxkprit') ? 90 : 2000
  
  if (ticketsSold >= limit) {
    throw new Error('Event is sold out')  // Blocks registration
  }
  
  // Only reaches here if under limit
  sheet.appendRow([...data])
  return JSON.stringify({ success: true })
}
```

## Benefits

### For Users:
✅ **Less Pressure** - Don't see "only 5 left" causing panic  
✅ **Cleaner UI** - Focus on event content, not numbers  
✅ **Simpler Decision** - Book based on interest, not scarcity  
✅ **No FOMO** - Can't see how many others are registering  

### For Organizers:
✅ **Controlled Capacity** - Backend enforces 90 limit automatically  
✅ **No Manual Closing** - System auto-blocks at limit  
✅ **Accurate Count** - Always synced with Google Sheet  
✅ **Dual Protection** - Pre-check + backend validation  

### For Performance:
✅ **Faster Load** - No API calls on page load  
✅ **Smaller Bundle** - Removed counting logic  
✅ **Less Network** - Only checks when submitting  

---

## Monitoring (Admin Only)

### Check Current Count:

**Manual Check via Google Sheet:**
1. Open your registration spreadsheet
2. Filter by `Event ID = tedxkprit-2025`
3. Count rows

**API Check (not visible to users):**
```
GET https://your-script-url?action=getTicketCount&eventId=tedxkprit-2025

Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "ticketsSold": 87,
  "totalCapacity": 90
}
```

**Important:** Users cannot access this - it's CORS-protected and hidden.

---

## Testing

### Verify Hidden Count:

1. **Visit Events Page** (`/events`)
   - ✅ Should see: Event cards with title, date, price
   - ❌ Should NOT see: "X/Y sold", progress bars, percentages

2. **Visit Event Detail** (`/events/tedxkprit-2025-break-the-loop`)
   - ✅ Should see: Event info, speakers, agenda
   - ❌ Should NOT see: Ticket stats, remaining count

3. **Try Registration:**
   - If count < 90: Registration succeeds ✅
   - If count >= 90: Shows "SOLD OUT" error 🚫

### Test Sold Out:

1. Manually add 90 rows in Google Sheet
2. Try to register on website
3. Should see: "🎫 SOLD OUT! This event has reached its maximum capacity of 90 registrations."
4. Form should not submit

---

## Important Notes

### ⚠️ Still Need to Update Google Script

Even though UI is hidden, you **MUST** deploy the updated Google Script with 90 limit:

1. Go to https://script.google.com
2. Open your script
3. Update both places:
   ```javascript
   const totalCapacity = eventId.includes('tedxkprit') ? 90 : 2000;
   ```
4. Deploy new version

### Capacity Per Event:

- **TEDxKPRIT 2025:** 90 (hidden from UI, enforced in backend)
- **Origin 2025:** 2000 (hidden from UI, enforced in backend)
- **Other Events:** 2000 (hidden from UI, enforced in backend)

### Security:

- ✅ Count check API is CORS-protected
- ✅ Users cannot see actual numbers
- ✅ Cannot manipulate frontend to bypass limit
- ✅ Backend validation is final authority

5. Backend checks: 89 < 90 ✅
6. Registration succeeds
7. Confirmation email sent
```

2. Clicks "Book Now"
3. Fills form
4. Submits
5. Backend checks: 90 >= 90 ❌
6. Shows: "🎫 SOLD OUT!"
7. Registration blocked
```

### Registration #91+:
```
User Experience:
1. Sees clean event card (no count - looks same as before)
2. Clicks "Book Now"

## Emergency Changes

### To Change Limit Mid-Event:

**Quick Update:**
1. Open Google Apps Script
2. Change: `? 90 :` to `? 95 :` (new limit)
3. Save and deploy new version
4. Takes effect immediately

**No frontend rebuild needed!** Since UI doesn't show count, changing backend limit is enough.
