## 🎯 Custom Animation Added

Added new utility class in `globals.css`:

```css
.animate-pulse-slow {
  animation: pulse-slow 3s cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.6, 1) infinite;
}

@keyframes pulse-slow {
  0%, 100% {
    opacity: 1;
  }
  50% {
    opacity: 0.85;
  }
}
```

This creates a gentle, attention-grabbing pulse effect on the Book Now button.
