# ✅ Google Analytics Setup Complete

## 📊 Google Analytics Tag Installed

Your Google Analytics (GA4) tracking tag has been successfully integrated into your matriXO website!

---

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### **Tracking ID:** `G-KFF7KV3Z11`

### **Location:** `app/layout.tsx` (Root Layout)

The Google Analytics tag has been added to the root layout, which means it will automatically load on **every page** of your website.

---

## 📝 Code Implementation

### Using Next.js `Script` Component (Optimized)

The implementation uses Next.js's built-in `Script` component with `strategy="afterInteractive"` for optimal performance:

```tsx
import Script from 'next/script'

// In the <body> section:
<Script
  src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-KFF7KV3Z11"
  strategy="afterInteractive"
/>
<Script id="google-analytics" strategy="afterInteractive">
  {`
    window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
    function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
    gtag('js', new Date());
    gtag('config', 'G-KFF7KV3Z11');
  `}
</Script>
```

### **Why `afterInteractive`?**
- ✅ Loads after the page becomes interactive
- ✅ Doesn't block critical page rendering
- ✅ Optimized for performance (recommended by Next.js)
- ✅ Better user experience compared to blocking scripts

## 🎯 Custom Event Tracking (Optional)

If you want to track specific events (e.g., button clicks, form submissions), you can add custom tracking:

### **Example: Track "Book Now" Button Clicks**

```tsx
// In your EventDetail.tsx or any component
const handleBookNowClick = () => {
  // Track event in Google Analytics
  if (typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.gtag) {
    window.gtag('event', 'book_now_click', {
      event_category: 'engagement',
      event_label: event.title,
      value: ticket.price
    })
  }
  
  // Your existing logic
  handleRegisterNow(ticket)
}
```

### **Example: Track Registration Submissions**

```tsx
// In EventRegistrationForm.tsx
const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {
  // ... existing code ...
  
  // Track successful registration
  if (typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.gtag) {
    window.gtag('event', 'registration_complete', {
      event_category: 'conversions',
      event_label: event.title,
      value: ticket.price,
      currency: 'INR'
    })
  }
}
```

### **Example: Track Payment Clicks**

```tsx
// In EventRegistrationForm.tsx
const handlePaymentClick = () => {
  if (typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.gtag) {
    window.gtag('event', 'payment_initiated', {
      event_category: 'ecommerce',
      event_label: `${event.title} - ${ticket.name}`,
      value: ticket.price,
      currency: 'INR'
    })
  }
  
  window.location.href = UPI_PAYMENT_LINK
  toast.info('Complete payment and upload screenshot below')
}
```

## 🔐 Privacy & GDPR Compliance

### **Current Setup:**
- Analytics loads on all pages automatically
- No cookie consent banner implemented yet

### **Recommended for GDPR Compliance:**

If your users are from EU/EEA, you should:

1. **Add a Cookie Consent Banner**
2. **Only load Analytics after user consent**
3. **Provide opt-out option**
4. **Update Privacy Policy** to mention Google Analytics usage

### **Quick Cookie Consent Example:**

```tsx
// Install: npm install react-cookie-consent
import CookieConsent from "react-cookie-consent"

// In layout.tsx, add before </body>:
<CookieConsent
  location="bottom"
  buttonText="Accept"
  declineButtonText="Decline"
  enableDeclineButton
  onAccept={() => {
    // Load GA only after consent
    window.gtag('consent', 'update', {
      analytics_storage: 'granted'
    })
  }}

- ✅ **afterInteractive** - Loads after page becomes interactive
- ✅ **Async loading** - Doesn't block page rendering
- ✅ **Minimal impact** - ~10-15KB gzipped

### **Page Speed:**
- No significant impact on Core Web Vitals
- LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) - Not affected
- FID (First Input Delay) - Not affected
- CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) - Not affected

## 🧹 Filtering Internal Traffic (Recommended)

To avoid tracking your own visits during development:

1. Go to **Admin** → **Data Streams** → Click your stream
2. Click **Configure tag settings**
3. Click **Show all** → **Define internal traffic**
4. Add rule: IP address equals your IP
5. Save

Or use a browser extension to block GA during development:
- [Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout)

---

## 📱 Events Automatically Tracked

GA4 automatically tracks these events without additional code:

| Event Name | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `page_view` | Every page navigation |
| `scroll` | User scrolls to 90% of page |
| `click` | Outbound link clicks |
| `view_search_results` | Search interactions |
| `file_download` | PDF, ZIP, etc. downloads |
| `video_start` | Video playback start |
| `video_progress` | 10%, 25%, 50%, 75% milestones |
| `video_complete` | Video watched to end |

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **Not seeing data in Real-time reports?**

1. **Wait 24-48 hours** for data to fully populate
2. **Check browser console** for errors
3. **Disable ad blockers** - They block Google Analytics
4. **Use Incognito mode** to test
5. **Check if tag is firing** using Google Tag Assistant

### **Data looks incorrect?**

1. Make sure you're looking at the correct property (G-KFF7KV3Z11)
2. Check date range in reports
3. Verify timezone settings match your location
4. Internal traffic might be counted (see filtering section above)

### **Want to test without deploying?**

Analytics works on localhost! Just:
1. Run `npm run dev`
2. Visit http://localhost:3000
3. Check Real-time reports in Google Analytics
4. You should see yourself as an active user
